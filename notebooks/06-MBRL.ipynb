    "Model Based Reinforcement Learning was the initial objective of this trading strategy. MBRL has the following steps:\n",
    "1. Create the model, replay buffers, environment and any preprocessing steps (like an auto-encoder).\n",
    "2. Collect experience and train the and dynamics model.\n",
    "3. Train the agent using the model and environment rollouts.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence."
